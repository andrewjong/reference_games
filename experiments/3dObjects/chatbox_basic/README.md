"3dObjects chatbox" experiment:

This experiment uses the same stimuli as the "sketchpad" experiment (see: 3dObjects/sketchpad_basic), but instead of a sketchpad interface, this experiment uses a 2-way chatbox interface. 

(same stimuli)
There are four categories containing eight objects each. 
The categories are: birds, chairs, cars, dogs. 

Objects were grouped into eight quartets:
Four of these quartets contained objects from the same category ("close");
the other four of these quartets contained objects from different categories ("far").

Each quartet was presented four times, such that each object in the quartet served as the target exactly once. 

On each trial, one quartet of objects shown. The speaker's task was to send messages that describe the cued object such that the listener could identify it from the quartet.
