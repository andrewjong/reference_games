"Chairs chatbox" experiment:

This experiment is adopted from the chatbox_basic experiment, but with different stimuli and design. In this experiment, there is only one category: chairs.

The chairs are organized into 9-chair "families" of three triplets each:

Families are split up by condition. Each family has a 'close' triplet, a 'far' triplet, and a split' triplet. 

Triplets have three chairs each: note that member 'a' is always the target, whereas 'b' and 'c' are the distractors.


23 triplets x 3 conditions = 69 trials


On each trial, one triplet of objects were shown. Each triplet was presented exactly once. The speaker's task was to send messages that describe the cued chair such that the listener could identify it from the triplet.
